* For OS X, if objdump is not installed, use otool to build payloads
  (without their source as side comments).
* Write AIX-specific objdump2h.awk and objdump2rb.awk.
* Write a tool to identify the numbers of the system calls used in the AIX
  payloads to ease adding support to AIX versions.
* Generate stagers from added payloads.
* Document what are singles and stagers and the difference between these.
* Validate and add other payloads.
* Add Windows support.
